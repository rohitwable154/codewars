/**
 * Find the Difference
 *
 * Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
 *
 * String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
 *
 * Find the letter that was added in t.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "abcd"
 * t = "abcde"
 *
 * Output:
 * e
 *
 * Explanation:
 * 'e' is the letter that was added.
