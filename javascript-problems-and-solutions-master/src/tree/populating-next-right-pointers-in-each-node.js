/**
 * Given a binary tree
 *
 *     struct TreeLinkNode {
 *       TreeLinkNode *left;
 *       TreeLinkNode *right;
 *       TreeLinkNode *next;
 *     }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
 * For example,
 * Given the following perfect binary tree,
 *
 *          1
 *        /  \
 *       2    3
 *      / \  / \
 *     4  5  6  7
 *
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 *
 *          1 -> NULL
 *        /  \
 *       2 -> 3 -> NULL
 *      / \  / \
 *     4->5->6->7 -> NULL
 *
 *
 * Since it's a full binary tree, our job is much simpler, at each node, connects its left and right child,
 * and try to connect the right child with the left child of node's next. A simple preorder traversal should
 * be able to help us solve this problem.
