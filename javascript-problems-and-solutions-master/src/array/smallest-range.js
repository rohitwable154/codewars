/**
 * Smallest Range
 *
 * You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes
 * at least one number from each of the k lists.
 *
 * We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
 * Output: [20,24]
 *
 * Explanation:
 * List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
 * List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
 * List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
