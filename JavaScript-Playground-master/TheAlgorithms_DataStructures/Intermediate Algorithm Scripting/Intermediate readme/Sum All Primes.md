Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.

```js
function sumPrimes(num) {
  let i = 1;
  let sum = 0;
  while (i <= num) {
    if (isPrime(i)) {
      sum += i;
    }
    i++;
  }
  return sum;
}
//function to check if a number is prime or not
function isPrime(x) {
  for (let i = 2; i < x; i++) {
    if (x % i === 0) return false;
  }
  return x !== 1 && x !== 0;
}
//test here
sumPrimes(10);
