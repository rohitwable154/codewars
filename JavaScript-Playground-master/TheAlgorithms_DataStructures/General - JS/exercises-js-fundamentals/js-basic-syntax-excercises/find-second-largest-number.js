input: a pile of numbers, call it PILE

// Comment: The idea is to keep track of the two-largest numbers we've seen as we
// look through the stack of cards. To start, we look at the first two cards
// and arrange them according to which is largest and which is second-largest so far.

put aside one sticky note, call it MAX_SO_FAR
put aside another sticky note, call it SECOND_MAX_SO_FAR

write down first number in PILE, call it FIRST_NUMBER
write down second number in PILE, call it SECOND_NUMBER

if FIRST_NUMBER > SECOND_NUMBER, then:
  replace value of MAX_SO_FAR with value of FIRST_NUMBER
  replace value of SEOND_MAX_SO_FAR with SECOND_NUMBER
otherwise:
  replace value of MAX_SO_FAR with value of SECOND_NUMBER
  replace value of SEOND_MAX_SO_FAR with FIRST_NUMBER
end if

foreach NUMBER in PILE, do the following:
  if NUMBER > MAX_SO_FAR, then:
    // Comment: Since NUMBER > MAX_SO_FAR, the largest we've seen so far is now the second-largest we've seen so far

    replace value of SECOND_MAX_SO_FAR with value of MAX_SO_FAR
    replace value of MAX_SO_FAR with value of NUMBER
  otherwise, if NUMBER > SECOND_MAX_SO_FAR, then:
    // Comment: We know NUMBER is between MAX_SO_FAR and SEOND_MAX_SO_FAR, so NUMBER is now second-largest we've seen

    replace value of SECOND_MAX_SO_FAR with value of NUMBER
