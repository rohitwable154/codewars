/*
 * The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one.
 * This single instance is called the singleton.
 * Singletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central place.
 * An example is a database connection pool. The pool manages the creation, destruction, and lifetime of all
 * database connections for the entire application ensuring that no connections are 'lost'.
