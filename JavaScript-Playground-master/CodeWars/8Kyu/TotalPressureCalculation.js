8kyu - Total Pressure Calcuation

Given the moleculer mass of two molecules ( M1 and M2 ), their 
masses present ( m1 and m2 ) in a vessel of volume ( V ) at a 
specific temperature ( T ). Find the total pressure exerted by the 
molecules ( Ptotal ) .

input
Six values :

m1
m2
M1
M2
V
T
output
One value :

Ptotal
notes
Units for each of the following are given as under :

m1 = gram
m2 = gram
M1 = gram.mole-1
M2 = gram.mole-1
V = dm3
T = Celcius
Ptotal = atmpspheric pressure (atm)
Remember : Temperature is given in Celcius while SI unit is Kelvin (K)

0 Celcius = 273.15Kelvin

The gas constant (R) has value of 0.082dm3.atm.K-1.mol-1

solution = (M1, M2, m1, m2, V, t) => {
    const T = t + 273.15
    return ((m1 / M1) + (m2 / M2)) * (0.082 * T) / V;
