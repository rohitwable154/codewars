/* 

8kyu - Basic subclasses - Adam and Eve

According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eva were the 
first Humans to wander the earth.

You have to do Godâ€™s job. The creation method must return an array of length 2 
containing objects representing Adam and Eva. The first object in the array should 
be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of the class Woman. 
Both objects have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to implement the Human, 
Man and Woman classes.
