5 kyu - Maximum Subarray Sum

Description:

The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous 
subsequence in an array or list of integers:

maxSequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])
 should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]
Easy case is when the list is made up of only positive numbers and the maximum sum is 
the sum of the whole array. If the list is made up of only negative numbers, return 0 instead.

Empty list is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty list or array is 
also a valid sublist/subarray.

My Note : This is a very bruteforce method that I should improve on, but for posterity I
will keep to note my progress.
