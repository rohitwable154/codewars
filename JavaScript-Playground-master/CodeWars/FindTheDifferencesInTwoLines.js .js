 Find the Differences in Two Lines 

At first, it may look easy, but it isn't...
Given two versions of the same line as arguments, you have to find the difference between them.
You have to write a function which will find:

The index where the changes begin
The characters which were added
The characters which were deleted
and return an object with the following values:
{ index: integer, addedText: string, deletedText: string }
Specification
addedText and deletedText should be as short as possible.
If it can be satisfied in several ways by equally short values, the returned object must have a maximum index.
If the two string arguments are the same, then the function has to return the following
{index: -1, addedText: '', deletedText: ''}
Examples
findDifferent('aasaa','asaa') // {index: 1, addedText: "saa", deletedText: "asaa"} - "incorrect"
findDifferent('aasaa','asaa') // {index: 1, addedText: "", deletedText: "a"} - "correct"

findDifferent("added", "added added")
// {index: 0, addedText: "added ", deletedText: ""} - "incorrect"
// {index: 5, addedText: " added", deletedText: ""} - "correct"

findDifferent("Hello John, how are you?", "Hello Jane, how are you?") 
// {index: 7, addedText: "ane", deletedText: "ohn"}

findDifferent("Hello, how is going your day?", "Hey, how is going your day?")
// {index: 2, addedText: "y", deletedText: "llo"}

findDifferent('The same text', 'The same text') // {index: -1, addedText: '', deletedText: ''};
