 7kyu - Find all non-consecutive Numbers

 Your task is to find all the elements of an array that are not consecutive.

 Create a function named allNonConsecutive

 E.g., if we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10] then 6 and 10 are non-consecutive.

 You should return the results as an array of objects with two values i: <the index of the non-consecutive number> and n: <the non-consecutive number>.
 E.g., for the above array the result should be:

 [
   {i: 4, n:6},
   {i: 7, n:10}
 ]
 If the whole array is consecutive, then return an empty array.

 The array will always have at least 2 elements and all the elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive and/or negetive.
