 7kyu - Asterisk It

 You are given a function that must insert an asterisk between every pair of even digits in an integer n, that should be converted to a string(toString), received as parameter and return it.
 n can be  string/an array containing integers only.
 If n is an array, put the elements together then put the asterisk, treating them as a string. e.g. [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] ==> "12*4*816"
 Here we will consider all the numbers that n % 2 == 0 as even numbers.
 Have fun!
