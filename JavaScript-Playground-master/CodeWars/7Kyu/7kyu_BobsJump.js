 7kyu - Bob's Jump

 Bob has ladder. He wants to climb this ladder, but being a precocious child, he wonders about exactly how many ways he could to climb this n size ladder using jumps of up to distance k.
 Consider this example...

 n = 5
 k = 3

 Here, Bob has ladder of length 5, and with each jump, he can ascend up to 3 steps (he can either jump step 1 or 2 or 3). This gives the below possibilities

 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 2
 1 1 2 1 
 1 2 1 1
 2 1 1 1
 1 2 2
 2 2 1
 2 1 2
 1 1 3
 1 3 1
 3 1 1
 2 3
 3 2

 Your task to calculate number of ways to climb ladder of length n with upto k steps for Bob. (13 in above case)

 Constraints:

 1<=n<=50
 1<=k<=15
