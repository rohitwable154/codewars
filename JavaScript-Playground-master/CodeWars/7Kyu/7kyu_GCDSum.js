 7kyu - GCD Sum

 Given the sum and gcd of two numbers, return those two numbers in ascending order. If the numbers do not exist, return -1, (or return NULL in C).

 For example: 
 Given sum = 12 and gcd = 4...

 solve(12,4) = [4,8]. The two numbers 4 and 8 sum to 12 and have a gcd of 4.
 solve(12,5) = -1. No two numbers exist that sum to 12 and have gcd of 5.
 solve(10,2) = [2,8]. Note that [4,6] is also a possibility but we pick the one with the lower first element: 2 < 4, so we take [2,8].

 More examples in test cases.

 Good luck.

 Translations welcome!
