// Description:

// I always thought that my old friend John was rather richer than he looked, but I never knew 
// exactly how much money he actually had. One day (as I was plying him with questions) he 
// said: "Imagine I have between m and n Zloty (or did he say Quetzal? I can't remember!)

//If I were to buy 9 cars costing c each, I'd only have 1 Zlotty (or was it Meticals?) left
//And if I were to buy 7 boats at b each, I'd only have 2 Ringglets (or was it Zlotty?) left.

// Could you tell me in each possible case:

// how much money f he could possibly have
// the cost c of a car
// the cost b of a boat?
// So, I will have a better idea about his fortune. Note that if m-n is big enough, 
// you might have a lot of possible answers.

// Each answer will be given as ["M: f", "B: b", "C: c"] and all the answers as 
// [ ["M: f", "B: b", "C: c"] ... ]. M stands for "Money", B for boats, C for cars.

// m and n are positive or null integers with m <= n or m >= n, m and n inclusive.

// Examples:

// howmuch(1, 100) => [["M: 37", "B: 5", "C: 4"], ["M: 100", "B: 14", "C: 11"]]
// howmuch(1000, 1100) => [["M: 1045", "B: 149", "C: 116"]]
// howmuch(10000, 9950) => [["M: 9991", "B: 1427", "C: 1110"]]
// howmuch(0, 200) => [["M: 37", "B: 5", "C: 4"], ["M: 100", "B: 14", "C: 11"], ["M: 163", "B: 23", "C: 18"]]
// Explanation of howmuch(1, 100):

// In the first answer his possible fortune is 37 so if he buys 7 boats each worth 5 it remains 37 - 7 * 5 = 2, 
//if he buys 9 cars worth 4 each it remains 37 - 9 * 4 = 1. The same with f = 100: 100 - 7 * 14 = 2 and 100 - 9 * 11 = 1.

// My Notes: This kata's description is pretty gibberish, but it boils down to, within the income range
// of m and n (not necessarily in order) find incomes where income - (9 * price of car) = 1 and where
// income - (7 * price of boat) = 2
