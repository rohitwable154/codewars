5kyu - Decimal to Factorial and Back

Coding decimal numbers with factorials is a way of writing out numbers in a base system that depends on factorials, rather than powers of numbers.

In this system, the last digit is always 0 and is in base 0!.
The digit before that is either 0 or 1 and is in base 1!. The digit before that is either 0, 1, or 2 and is in base 2!.

More generally, the nth-to-last digit is always 0, 1, 2, ..., or n and is in base n!.
Example :

decimal number 463 is coded as "341010":

463 (base 10) = 3×5! + 4×4! + 1×3! + 0×2! + 1×1! + 0×0!

If we are limited to digits 0...9 the biggest number we can code is 10! - 1.

So we extend 0..9 with letters A to Z. With these 36 digits we can code up to

36! − 1 = 37199332678990121746799944815083519999999910 (base 10)

We will code two functions. The first one will code a decimal number and return a string with the factorial representation : dec2FactString(nb)

The second one will decode a string with a factorial representation and produce the decimal representation : factString2Dec(str).

Given numbers will be positive.
Note

You have tests with Big Integers in Clojure, Julia, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Ocaml, Racket but not with Java and others where the number "nb" in "dec2FactString(nb)" is at most a long.
