/*
Description:
Write a function that accepts two parameters (a and b) and says whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b.

Here is an example code:

var noIfsNoButs = function (a,b) {
  if(a > b) return a + " is greater than " + b
  else if(a < b) return a + " is smaller than " + b
  else if(a == b) return a + " is equal to " + b
}
There's only one problem...

You can't use if statements, and you can't use shorthands like (a < b)?true:false;

in fact the word "if" and the character "?" are not allowed in the code.

Inputs are guarenteed to be numbers
*/
var noIfsNoButs = function(a, b) {
  switch (Math.sign(a - b)) {
    case 1:
      return `${a} is greater than ${b}`;
    case -1:
      return `${a} is smaller than ${b}`;
    case 0:
      return `${a} is equal to ${b}`;
  }
};
