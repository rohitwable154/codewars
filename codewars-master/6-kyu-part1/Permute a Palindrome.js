/*
Description:
Write a function that will check whether the permutation of an input string is a palindrome. Bonus points for a solution that is efficient and/or that uses only built-in language functions. Deem yourself brilliant if you can come up with a version that does not use any function whatsoever.

Example
madam -> True
adamm -> True
junk -> False

Hint
The brute force approach would be to generate all the permutations of the string and check each one of them whether it is a palindrome. However, an optimized approach will not require this at all.
