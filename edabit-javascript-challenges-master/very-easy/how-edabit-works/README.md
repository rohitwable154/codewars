This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the **Code**tab you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

    function hello() {

    }

All you have to do is type `return "hello edabit.com"`between the curly braces and click the **Check**button. If everything went according to plan, the button will turn red and say **SUBMIT FINAL**. Click it and see what happens.


### Notes ###
*   Don't forget to `return`the result.
*   If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the **Resources**tab.
*   If you're *really*stuck, unlock solutions in the **Solutions**tab.
