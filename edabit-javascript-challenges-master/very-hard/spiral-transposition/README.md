Create a function that takes a two-dimensional array as an argument and returns a one-dimensional array with the values of the original 2d array that are arranged by spiralling through it (starting from the top-left).


### Examples ###
    spiral([
      [7, 2],
      [5, 0]
    ])

    ➞ [7, 2, 0, 5]

    spiral([
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ])

    ➞ [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]

    spiral([
      [1, 1, 1],
      [4, 5, 2],
      [3, 3, 2]
    ])

    ➞ [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]


### Notes ###
If you do not understand the instructions, write the 3x3 array example on a piece of paper and trace the output through it.
