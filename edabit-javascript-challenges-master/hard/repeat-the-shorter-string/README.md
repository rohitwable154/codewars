Write a function that repeats the shorter string until it is equal to the length of the longer string.


### Examples ###
    lengthen("abcdefg", "ab") ➞ "abababa"

    lengthen("ingenius", "forest") ➞ "forestfo"

    lengthen("clap", "skipping") ➞ "clapclap"


### Notes ###
*   Both strings will differ in length.
*   Both strings will contain at least one character.
