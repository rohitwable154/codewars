Create a function that decomposes an integer into its prime factors, ordered from smallest to largest.

For instance:

    completeFactorization(24) = [2, 2, 2, 3]
    // Since 24 = 8 x 3 = 2^3 x 3 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3


### Examples ###
    completeFactorization(10) ➞ [2, 5]

    completeFactorization(9) ➞ [3, 3]

    completeFactorization(72) ➞ [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]


### Notes ###
`1`is not considered a prime number, so omit it in your final array of prime factors.
