Write a function that swaps the first **pair**(1st and 2nd characters) with the second **pair**(3rd and 4th characters) for every quadruplet substring.


### Examples ###
    swapTwo("ABCDEFGH") ➞ "CDABGHEF"

    swapTwo("AABBCCDDEEFF") ➞ "BBAADDCCFFEE"

    swapTwo("munchkins") ➞ "ncmuinhks"

    swapTwo("FFGGHHI") ➞ "FFGGIHH"


### Notes ###
Keep **leftover strings**in the same order.
