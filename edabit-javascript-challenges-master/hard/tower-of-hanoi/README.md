There are 3 towers. Object of the game is to move all the disks over to Tower 3. But you cannot place a larger disk onto a smaller disk. To play the game, go to the **resources tab**.

Create a function that takes a number `discs`as an argument and returns the minimum amount of steps needed to complete the game.


### Examples ###
    towerHanoi(3) ➞ 7

    towerHanoi(5) ➞ 31

    towerHanoi(0) ➞ 0


### Notes ###
The amount of discs is always a positive integer.
