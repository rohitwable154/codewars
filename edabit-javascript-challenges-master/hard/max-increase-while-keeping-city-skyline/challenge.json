  "instructions": "<p><span>In a 2 dimensional array, each value represents the height of a building located there. You are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings).</span></p><p><span>At the end, the \"skyline\" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance.</span></p><h3><span>Examples</span></h3><pre><code>[\n  [3, 0, 8, 4],\n  [2, 4, 5, 7],\n  [9, 2, 6, 3],\n  [0, 3, 1, 0]\n]\n\n// Skyline viewed from top or bottom: [9, 4, 8, 7]\n// Skyline viewed from left or right: [8, 7, 9, 3]\n\n[\n  [8, 0, 8, 7],\n  [7, 4, 7, 7],\n  [9, 4, 8, 7],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0]\n]\n\n// Grid after increasing the height of buildings\n// without affecting skylines.</code></pre><h3><span>Notes</span></h3><p><span>Height </span><code>0</code><span> is considered to be a protected park and nothing should be built on top of it.</span></p>",
