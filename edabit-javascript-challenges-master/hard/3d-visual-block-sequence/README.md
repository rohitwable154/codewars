A block sequence in three dimensions. We can write a formula for this one:

![Sequence Step 1 - 5](<https://edabit-challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/3d_blocks.png> "Sequence Step 1 - 5")

Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the amount of blocks in that step.


### Examples ###
    blocks(1) ➞ 5

    blocks(5) ➞ 39

    blocks(2) ➞ 12


### Notes ###
*   Step 0 obviously has to return `0`.
*   The input is always a positive integer.
*   Check the **Resources Tab**for a nice video on how to find quadratic sequences.
