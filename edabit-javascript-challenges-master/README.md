# edabit-javascript-challenges

Javascript challenges forked from Edabit.

Now you can do the challenges locally, using whichever IDE you prefer.

## Install Node / NPM

You will need to install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org and ensure that
you can run the `npm` command by running

``` shell
npm version
```

and verifying that you see the NPM version, and not an error.

## Trying a challenge

To try a challenge:

- Change in to to the directory containing the challenge.

- Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

- Read `README.md` for a description of the problem.

- Read the tests in `code.spec.js` to get a better understanding of
  exactly what parameters the code you will write should take, and
  the values your code should return.
  
- Run the tests wth `npm test`. They should fail.

- Edit the function in `code.js`. When you think you have written the
  code correctly re-run the tests (`npm test`) to check. If they pass,
  great. If not, try and understand the failure, and edit your code to
  fix the problem. Then re-run the tests.
  
If you get stuck on a challenge, move on and try and different one for
a bit. This gives your mind the chance to subconsciously think about
the problem, and you can come back later and try and solve it again.
