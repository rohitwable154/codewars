Create a function that accepts an array of two strings and checks if the letters in the second string are present in the first string.


### Examples ###
    letterCheck(["trances", "nectar"]) ➞ true

    letterCheck(["compadres", "DRAPES"]) ➞ true

    letterCheck(["parses", "parsecs"]) ➞ false


### Notes ###
*   Function should not be case sensitive (as indicated in the second example).
*   Both strings are presented as a single argument in the form of an array.
*   Bonus if you can do this without RegEx.
