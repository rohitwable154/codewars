Create a function that returns `true`if a number is prime and `false`if it's not. A prime number is any positive integer that is evenly divisible by only two divisors: 1 and itself. The first ten prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29.


### Examples ###
    isPrime(7) ➞ true

    isPrime(9) ➞ false

    isPrime(10) ➞ false


### Notes ###
*   1 is not a prime number.
*   If a number is odd it is not divisible by an even number.
