Create a function that counts the number of **adverbs**in a sentence. An adverb is a word that ends with `ly`.


### Examples ###
    countAdverbs("She ran hurriedly towards the stadium.") ➞ 1

    countAdverbs("She ate the lasagna heartily and noisily.") ➞ 2

    countAdverbs("He hates potatoes.") ➞ 0

    countAdverbs("He was happily, crazily, foolishly over the moon.") ➞ 3


### Notes ###
*   Do NOT count words where the `ly`is in the beginning or the middle (e.g. Lysol, Illya).
*   For the purpose of this exercise, ignore the nuances of the English language (some adjectives also end in `ly`).
