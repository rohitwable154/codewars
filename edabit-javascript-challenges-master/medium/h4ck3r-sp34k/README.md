Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a coded (h4ck3r 5p34k) version of the string.


### Examples ###
    hackerSpeak("javascript is cool") ➞ "j4v45cr1pt 15 c00l"

    hackerSpeak("programming is fun") ➞ "pr0gr4mm1ng 15 fun"

    hackerSpeak("become a coder") ➞ "b3c0m3 4 c0d3r"


### Notes ###
In order to work properly, the function should replace all 'a's with 4, 'e's with 3, 'i's with 1, 'o's with 0, and 's's with 5.
