### Examples ###
    sortByCharacter(["az16", "by35", "cx24"], 2) ➞ ["cx24", "by35", "az16"]
    // By 2nd character: ["x", "y", "z"] is in alphabetical order.

    sortByCharacter(["mayor", "apple", "petal"], 5) ➞ ["apple", "petal", "mayor"]
    // By 5th character: ["e", "l", "r"] is in alphabetical order.

    sortByCharacter(["mate", "team", "bade"], 3) ➞ ["team", "bade", "mate"]


### Notes ###
All inputs will be of same length.
