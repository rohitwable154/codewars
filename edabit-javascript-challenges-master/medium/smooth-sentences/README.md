Carlos is a huge fan of something he calls **smooth sentences**. A smooth sentence is one where the last letter of each word is identical to the first letter the following word.

To illustrate, the following would be a smooth sentence: *"Carlos swam masterfully."*

Since "Carlos" ends with an "s" and swam begins with an "s" and swam ends with an "m" and masterfully begins with an "m".


### Examples ###
    isSmooth("Marta appreciated deep perpendicular right trapezoids") ➞ true
