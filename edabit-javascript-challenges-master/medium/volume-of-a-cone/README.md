Create a function that takes the height and radius of a cone as arguments and returns the volume of the cone. See the resources tab for the formula.

### Examples ###
    coneVolume(3, 2) ➞ 12.57

    coneVolume(15, 6) ➞ 565.49

    coneVolume(18, 0) ➞ 0


### Notes ###
*   Return approximate answer by rounding the answer to the nearest hundredth.
*   Use JavaScript's PI property, don't fall for 3.14 ;-)
*   If the cone has no volume, return 0.
