Write a function that select all words that shares the same vowels (in any ordering) as the first word in the array.


### Examples ###
    sameVowelGroup(["toe", "ocelot", "maniac"]) ➞ ["toe", "ocelot"]

    sameVowelGroup(["many", "carriage", "emit", "apricot", "animal"]) ➞ ["many"]

    sameVowelGroup(["hoops", "chuff", "bot", "bottom"]) ➞ ["hoops", "bot", "bottom"]


### Notes ###
*   Words will contain only **lowercase letters**, and **may contain whitespaces**.
*   Frequency **does not**matter (e.g. if "loopy", then you can include words with any number of o's, so long as they **only**contain o's, and not any other vowels).
