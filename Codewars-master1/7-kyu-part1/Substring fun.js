/*
Description:
Function nthChar takes 1 parameter - an array of words.

You must concatenate the nth letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string.

Note: Test cases contain valid input only - i.e. a string array or an empty array, each word will have at least as many letters as its ordinal position.

  let str = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    str += words[i][i];
  }
