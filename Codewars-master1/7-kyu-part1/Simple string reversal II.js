/*
Description:
In this Kata, you will be given a string and two indexes. Your task is to reverse the portion of that string between those two indices inclusive.

solve("codewars",1,5) = "cawedors" -- elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
solve("cODEWArs", 1,5) = "cAWEDOrs" -- to help visualize.
Input will be lowercase and uppercase letters only.

More examples in the test cases. Good luck!

      .split("")
      .reverse()
      .join("") +
    st.slice(b + 1)
  );
}
