/*
Description:
An element in an array is dominant if it is greater than all elements to its right. You will be given an array and your task will be to return a list of all dominant elements. For example:

solve([1,21,4,7,5]) = [21,7,5] because 21, 7 and 5 are greater than elments to their right. 
solve([5,4,3,2,1]) = [5,4,3,2,1]

Notice that the last element is always included.
More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!
