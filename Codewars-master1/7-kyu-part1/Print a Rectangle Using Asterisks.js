/*
Description:
Write a method that, given two arguments, width and height, returns a string representing a rectangle with those dimensions.

The rectangle should be filled with spaces, and its borders should be composed of asterisks (*).

For example, the following call:

getRectangleString(3, 3);
Should return the following string:

***
* *
***
End each line of the string (including the last one) with a carriage return-line feed combination.

Note: You may assume that width and height will always be greater than zero.
*/
function getRectangleString(width, height) {
  if (width === 1 && height === 1) return "*\r\n";
  if (width === 1 && height === 2) return "*\r\n*\r\n";
  let start = "*".repeat(width) + "\r\n";
  let mid = "*" + " ".repeat(width - 2) + "*" + "\r\n";
  let end = mid.repeat(height - 2);
  return start + end + start;
