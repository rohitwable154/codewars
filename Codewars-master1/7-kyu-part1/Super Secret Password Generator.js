Description:
Sys Admins are always on your case to improve the strength of your passwords. You could really use a handy function to make your passwords completely un-hackable.

Use the super secret characters in the superSecretChars variable to replace the matching characters in your totally insecure password and make it un-hackable.

eg. replace all 'a's with '@'s. Make sure you get the upper case characters too just in case the user wants to SHOUT their password at you.
