Description:
Coding 3min: Father and Son

This is the simple version of Shortest Code series. If you need some challenges, please try the challenge version

#Task:
Every uppercase letter is Father, The corresponding lowercase letters is the Son.

Give you a string ```s```, If the father and son both exist, keep them. If it is a separate existence, delete them. Return the result.

For example: 

```sc("Aab")``` should return ```"Aa"```

```sc("AabBc")``` should return ```"AabB"```

```sc("AaaaAaab")``` should return ```"AaaaAaa"```(father can have a lot of son)

```sc("aAAAaAAb")``` should return ```"aAAAaAA"```(son also can have a lot of father ;-)

function sc(s) {
  let obj = {};
  s.split``.map(v => (obj[v] = obj[v] ? obj[v] + 1 : 1));
  return s.split``.map(v => {
    let upper = v.toUpperCase();
    let low = v.toLowerCase();
    if (obj[upper] >= 1 && obj[low] >= 1) {
      return v;
    }
    return (v = "");
  }).join``;
}
