/*
Description:
Find the difference between two collections. The difference means that either the character is present in one collection or it is present in other, but not in both. Return a sorted set with difference.

The collections can contain any character and can contain duplicates.

For instance:

A = [a,a,t,e,f,i,j]

B = [t,g,g,i,k,f]

difference = [a,e,g,j,k]
*/
function diff(a, b) {
  const sort1 = a.filter(v => !b.includes(v));
  const sort2 = b.filter(v => !a.includes(v));
  return [...new Set(sort1.concat(sort2))].sort();
}
