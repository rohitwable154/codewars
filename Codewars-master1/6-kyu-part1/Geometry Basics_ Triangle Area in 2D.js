Description:
This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

Point objects have x, y attributes. Triangle objects have attributes a, b, c describing their corners, each of them is a Point.

Write a function calculating area of a Triangle defined this way.

Tests round answers to 6 decimal places.

function triangleArea(t) {
  let a = Math.hypot(t.a.x - t.b.x, t.a.y - t.b.y);
  let b = Math.hypot(t.b.x - t.c.x, t.b.y - t.c.y);
  let c = Math.hypot(t.c.x - t.a.x, t.c.y - t.a.y);
  let p = (a + b + c) / 2;
  let S = Math.sqrt(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c));
